# FPCC-FCAF3D

这是FPCC算法与FCAF3D/TR3D结合的训练日志，2D的部分使用YOLOv9-E 训练的结果也一并上传。论文录用后将公开源代码和其他原始数据。

This is the training log of the FPCC algorithm combined with FCAF3D/TR3D. The results of the 2D part using YOLOv9-E training are also uploaded. The source code and other original data will be made public after the paper is accepted.

我们采用的实验数据为SUN RGB-D数据，数据集以及数据集工具包的下载请参照MMdetection3d:https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/blob/main/data/sunrgbd/README.md 我们的FPCC组件是在训练前，数据预处理阶段进行操作，在论文发表前暂时无法公开，还请见谅。

The experimental data we use is from the SUN RGB-D dataset. For downloading the dataset and toolkit, please refer to MMDetection3D: https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d/blob/main/data/sunrgbd/README.md.

Our FPCC module operates during the data preprocessing stage before training and is temporarily unavailable for public release until the paper is published. We appreciate your understanding.
